Good afternoon.

I have a problem to send a POST with PHP-curl, when sending a curl_setopt_array () with many lines it does not record me, I have tried everything and it does not work, for example the code is fine, I have already tried it with postman and recording everything ok.

The code is as follows:
$ ch2 = curl_init ();
curl_setopt_array
(
$ ch2, array
(
CURLOPT_PORT => "xxxxx",
CURLOPT_URL => "My URL",
CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
CURLOPT_ENCODING => "",
CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS => 100,
CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 30,
CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION => CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1,
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => 0,
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => FALSE,
CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST => "POST",
CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => $mOrders
, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => $headers
)
);
$ cCargaRespuestaOrdenVenta = curl_exec ($ ch2);

In the variable $mOrders I save the data to be recorded.

Slds and thanks

 Freddy
